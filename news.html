	<li>Anytime a company spends money to acquire another company or assets - 20-25%</li>	
	<li style="background-color: #D3D3D3">REVERSE SPLIT</li>	
	<li class="indent">If a reverse stock split was announced in advance (at least 2 days) then we can consider the stock if it falls 25-30%.</li>
	<li class="indent">Day of announcement - 35%</li>
	<li class="indent">Day that the split takes place - 22% - <span style="background-color:#00FF00;">Later on in day (i.e. 	leaving for work) - 35%</span></li>
	<li class="indent">Day that split takes place + news (i.e. bad Seeking Alpha article) = 38-40% right off the bat</li>
	<li class="indent">"Approaching" reverse stock split - 19%</li>
	<li style="background-color: #D3D3D3">DELISTING</li>	
	<li class="indent">Day of delisting notice - 35-40% - if the volume is only around 66,000 shares then 51%</li>

	<li class="indent">Voluntarily delisting the next week - 55%</li>
	<li class="indent">Delisting a few days away - 50%</li>
	<li class="indent">If the company received the news from the exchange that they were not in compliance and they receive a delisting notice and had 120 or more days to get the price above $1 a share we would look for a 40% morning drop.  However, if the exchange indicates that the delisting will take place sooner or if the company announces they will be delisting their stock sooner, then we change our approach quickly.<br>
If the delisting is immediate, before the next day of trading we are at 65-70% early and quickly increase that as the day progresses.  However, if the desalting date (here it was October 6th) was a week away or more, we can consider the stock at 50-55% early on and look for a nice 10% or more gain as a result.</li>
	<li class="indent">
		When we see a delisting letter we place the stock in 40% pile early on.<br>
		If GLBR had announced they were being delisted today, the stock immediately becomes a 70-75% security for me.  If they are being delisted at the end of the week I might need 55% or more, as a way to buffer myself against a fall in price that we all know is coming.  In this case the company will be delisted in 13 trading days, so for me this was a 40-45% stock at the opening bell and I increased that percentage as the morning wore on
